Structural markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
 Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on

 # Headings
 HTML has six "levels" of
headings:

`<h1>` is the largest heading

`<h2>`

`<h3>`

`<h4>`

`<h5>`

`<h6>` is the smallest heading

# Paragraph
To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening `<p>` tag and closing `</p>` tag.

## <b> Bold </b> & <i> Italic </i>
By enclosing words in the tags
`<b>` and `</b>` we can make
characters appear bold.

By enclosing words in the tags
`<i>` and `</i>` we can make
characters appear italic.

The `<sup>` element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or
mathematical concepts like
raising a number to a power such
as 2 <sup> 2.

The `<sub>` element is used to
contain characters that should
be subscript. It is commonly
used with foot notes or chemical
formulas such as H<sub>2</sub>0.

`<br />`
if you wanted
to add a line break inside the
middle of a paragraph you can
use the line break tag `<br/>`.

a
horizontal rule between sections
using the `<hr />` tag.

# Semantic Markup

## <strong>
The use of the `<strong>`
element indicates that its
content has strong importance.
For example, the words
contained in this element might
be said with strong emphasis.

## <em>
The `<em>` element indicates
emphasis that subtly changes
the meaning of a sentence.

## <blockquote>
The `<blockquote>` element is
used for longer quotes that take
up an entire paragraph.

`<q>`
The `<q>` element is used for
shorter quotes that sit within
a paragraph.

The <ins> element can be used
to show content that has been
inserted into a document, while
the <del> element can show text
that has been deleted from it.
