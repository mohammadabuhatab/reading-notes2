# IMAGES
## Adding Images
\<img> images.html HTML
To add an image into the page
you need to use an \<img>
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:</br>
src
This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site.</br>
alt
This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.</br>
title
You can also use the title
attribute with the \<img> element
to provide additional information
about the image. Most browsers
will display the content of this
attribute in a tootip when the
user hovers over the image.

## Images size
* height:
This specifies the height of the
image in pixels.

* width:
This specifies the width of the
image in pixels.
### align 
The align attribute was
commonly used to indicate how
the other parts of a page should
flow around an image. It has
been removed from HTML5
and new websites should use
CSS to control the alignment of
images.
* lift
* right
* top
* midlle
* bottom
